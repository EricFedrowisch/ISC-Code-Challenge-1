ISC Code Challenge 1
Thursday September 28th

The Challenge:
	There is a message encoded into the given image. The Challenge is to be the first 		person to complete the given code so that the message can be properly decoded and 		to be the first to send the message and the code used to decode it to the ISC email at 		ISC.Nicholls@gmail.com.  The time limit for participation is approximately one month. 		Results will be announced at the next ISC club meeting.

The Prizes:
	Those who complete the challenge will receive a certificate and recognition at the next 		meeting. The first three to complete it will also receive an additional prize!

What you will need:
The code and the image can be downloaded from this GitHub page here: LINK

You will also need to install Python 2.7. I would advise you use Anaconda as it comes with the Pillow Image Library used by the given code. You can get Anaconda here:  
https://www.anaconda.com/download/


Here you can find a thorough explanation of how to use Python on all major Operating Systems: https://opentechschool.github.io/python-beginners/en/getting_started.html

Though I canâ€™t help you with the coding parts directly I will answer questions on setting up Python and Anaconda to the best of my abilities. You can email questions to the ISC email or efedrowisch@its.nicholls.edu.

To successfully complete the challenge you will have to be able to do the following common Python Programming tasks:
Assign a variable
Program a nested for loop
Create and add to a list
Use the given decode function and give it a parameter
Do a boolean test
Do an If Statement
Print an output

Good luck and remember the best way to learn to program is to do some programming!
